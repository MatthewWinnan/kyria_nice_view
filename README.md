# Introduction

This will serve as some boiler plate introductions to the purpose of this repo.

It is effectively a clone of the nice-view shield code found within ZMK's
`3f6841c95ff9a82658576828895ebcba1b0a5f86`.

It is intended to be used along with my custom repository [ZMK-FACEHUGGER](https://github.com/MatthewWinnan/zmk-facehugger) in order to get use
to the overall development work flow and to achieve custom behavior for my keeb.

To see how this should be used please look at the excellent guide by [GPeye](https://github.com/GPeye/urchin-peripheral-animation/tree/main).
